# Python Data Analysis GUI

Welcome to the Python Data Analysis GUI, a versatile tool for data exploration and manipulation. With this application, you can easily load CSV files, perform various data cleaning and transformation tasks, and save your edited data back to CSV format.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load CSV files into memory for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess data using common methods such as sorting, aggregating, converting columns to datetime, and removing null values.
- **Data Merging**: Merge multiple datasets based on chosen columns and merge options.
- **Edits Tracking**: Keep track of the number of edits performed on the data.
- **CSV Export**: Save edited data as CSV files.

## Usage

1. **Load CSV**: Start by loading a CSV file into the application.
2. **Choose Operation**: Select from a range of operations including sorting, aggregating, converting columns, removing nulls, merging dataframes, and saving the edited data.
3. **Perform Operation**: Follow the prompts to perform the chosen operation on the loaded data.
4. **Save Results**: Save the edited data as a CSV file in the current working directory or specify a custom path.

## Example Workflow

1. Load a CSV file containing your data.
2. Choose an operation from the menu, such as sorting or aggregating.
3. Follow the prompts to select the columns and parameters for the operation.
4. Perform the operation and view the results.
5. Optionally, perform additional operations or merge datasets.
6. Save the final edited data as a CSV file for further analysis.
